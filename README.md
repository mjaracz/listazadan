<p>Then you may wonder, how easy is to download project on your computer, just typing command below in your favorite console.</p>

``` git clone https://github.com/mjaracz/listazadan.git```

Furthermore I recommend to have working mobile devices with android or IOS to starting app in server developer mode, and for ours testing purpose.
In device you should have install expo app.
